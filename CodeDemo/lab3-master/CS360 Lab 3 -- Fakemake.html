<hr>

Now we get to a more fun assignment.  The goal is to write a 
restricted and pared-down version of <b>make(1)</b>.
This will give you some practice using <b>stat(2v)</b> and
<b>system(3)</b>.

<hr><h2>Description of <b>fakemake</b></h2>

Your job is to write the program <b>fakemake</b>.  Like <b>make</b>, 
<b>fakemake</b>'s job is to help you automate compiling.  Unlike
<b>make</b>, <b>fakemake</b> limits itself to making one executable,
and assumes that you are using <b>gcc</b> to do your compilation.

<p> The syntax of <b>fakemake</b> is as follows:
</p><pre>fakemake [ description-file ]
</pre>
If no <b>description-file</b> is specified, then it assumes that the 
description file is the file <b>fmakefile</b>.  Obviously, if the
description file doesn't exist, then the program should exit with an 
error.

<p>Each line of the description file may be one of six things:
</p><ul>
<li> A blank line (i.e. a line containing only white space).
<p></p></li><li> A specification of C source files that are used to make the executable:
<pre>C list-of-files
</pre>
All files thus specified should end with <b>.c</b>.  
Multiple files can be separated
by whitespace.  The list may be empty, and there can be multiple lines
starting with <b>C</b>.
<p></p></li><li> A specification of C header files that may be included by any source
file:
<pre>H list-of-files
</pre>
The <b>H</b> list is formatted just like the <b>C</b> list, and
there can be multiple lines starting with <b>H</b>.
<p></p></li><li> A specification of the name of the executable:
<pre>E name
</pre>
There can be only one executable name; thus, there can be only one
line starting with <b>E</b>.  
It is an error if there is no <b>E</b> line in
the entire description file.
<p></p></li><li> A specification of compilation flags:
<pre>F flags
</pre>
These flags
will be included right after <b>gcc</b> whenever it is called.
As before, the flags are separated by whitespace, and 
there can be multiple <b>F</b> lines.
This can be empty as well.
<p></p></li><li> A specification of libraries or extra object files for linking
<pre>L list-of-libraries
</pre>
As before, multiple files should be separated
by whitespace.  The list may be empty, and there can be multiple lines
starting with <b>L</b>.  This list is included at the end of the final
<b>gcc</b> command that makes the executable.
</li></ul>

<p>What <b>fakemake</b> does is compile all the <b>.c</b> files into 
<b>.o</b> files (using <b>gcc -c</b>), and then compile all the <b>.o</b>
files into the final executable.  Like <b>make</b>, it doesn't recompile
files if it is not necessary.  It uses the following
algorithm to decide whether or not to compile the <b>.c</b> files: 
</p><ul>
<li> If there is no <b>.o</b> file corresponding to the <b>.c</b> file,
then the <b>.c</b> file must be compiled (with <b>-c</b>).
</li><li> If there is a <b>.o</b> file corresponding to the <b>.c</b> file, 
but the <b>.c</b> file is more recent, then the <b>.c</b> file must
be compiled (again with <b>-c</b>).
</li><li> If there is a <b>.o</b> file corresponding to the <b>.c</b> file,
and <i>any</i> of the <b>.h</b> files are more recent than the <b>.o</b>
file, then the <b>.c</b> file must be compiled.
</li></ul>
If the executable file exists, and is more recent than the <b>.o</b>
files, and no <b>.c</b> file has been recompiled, then <b>fakemake</b>
does not remake the executable.  Otherwise, it does remake the executable
(using <b>gcc -o</b>).

<p>Obviously, if a <b>.c</b> or <b>.h</b> file is specified, and it does not
exist, <b>fakemake</b> should exit with an error.  If there are any 
compilation errors mid-stream, <b>fakemake</b> should exit immediately.

</p><hr><h2>Example</h2>

For example, get into a clean directory and then type
<pre>UNIX&gt; <b>cp ~huangj/cs360/labs/lab3/* .</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>ls</b>
f.c             f.h             f2.c            makefile        mysort.fm
f.fm            f1.c            lab.html        mysort.c
UNIX&gt; <b>make</b>
gcc -c -g f.c
gcc -c -g f1.c
gcc -c -g f2.c
gcc -g -o f f.o f1.o f2.o
gcc -c -g -I/home/huangj/cs360/include mysort.c
gcc -g -o mysort mysort.o /home/huangj/cs360/objs/libfdr.a 
UNIX&gt; <b>f</b>
This is the procedure F1 -- in f1.c
This is the procedure F2 -- in f2.c
UNIX&gt; <b>mysort &lt; f.c</b>
  f1();
  f2();
main()
{
}
UNIX&gt; <b>make clean</b>
rm -f core *.o f mysort
UNIX&gt; <b>ls</b>
f.c             f.h             f2.c            makefile        mysort.fm
f.fm            f1.c            lab.html        mysort.c
UNIX&gt;
</pre>
So, this directory contains source code for two programs.  The first, 
<b>f</b>, is made up of three C files: 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/f.c"><b>f.c</b></a>, 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/f1.c"><b>f1.c</b></a> and
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/f2.c"><b>f2.c</b></a>, 
and one header file: 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/f.h"><b>f.h</b></a>.
The second is 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/mysort.c"><b>mysort.c</b></a>
from the <b>Rbtree-1</b> lecture.  The <b>makefile</b> contains a specification 
of how to make these programs using <b>make</b>.  The file 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/f.fm"><b>f.fm</b></a> is
the <b>fakemake</b> file for making <b>f</b>, and 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/labs/lab3/mysort.fm"><b>mysort.fm</b></a> is
the <b>fakemake</b> file for making <b>mysort</b>.  Try it out, using the
<b>fakemake</b> executable in
<b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake</b>:
<pre>UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake</b>
fakemake: fmakefile No such file or directory
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
gcc -c -g f.c
gcc -c -g f1.c
gcc -c -g f2.c
gcc -o f -g f.o f1.o f2.o
UNIX&gt; <b>touch f.c         </b>
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
gcc -c -g f.c
gcc -o f -g f.o f1.o f2.o
UNIX&gt; <b>rm f</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
gcc -o f -g f.o f1.o f2.o
UNIX&gt; <b>touch f.h</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
gcc -c -g f.c
gcc -c -g f1.c
gcc -c -g f2.c
gcc -o f -g f.o f1.o f2.o
UNIX&gt; <b>touch f.h</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>touch f.o f1.o</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
gcc -c -g f2.c
gcc -o f -g f.o f1.o f2.o
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
f up to date
UNIX&gt; <b>f</b>
This is the procedure F1 -- in f1.c
This is the procedure F2 -- in f2.c
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake mysort.fm</b>
gcc -c -g -I/home/huangj/cs360/include mysort.c
gcc -o mysort -g -I/home/huangj/cs360/include mysort.o /home/huangj/cs360/objs/libfdr.a
UNIX&gt; <b>mysort &lt; f.c</b>
  f1();
  f2();
main()
{
}
UNIX&gt; <b>rm f.h</b>
UNIX&gt; <b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake f.fm</b>
fmakefile: f.h: No such file or directory
UNIX&gt; <b></b>
</pre>
As you can see, <b>fm</b> works according to the above specification.  It only
recompiles modules when it needs to.  When you're in doubt about what
your <b>fakemake</b> should do, see what
<b>~cs360/lab3/fakemake</b>
does and emulate its behavior.

<hr><h2>Details</h2>

Obviously, you'll have to use <b>stat()</b> to test the ages of programs.
The <b>st_mtime</b> field of the <b>struct stat</b> should be used as the
age of the program.

<p>To execute a string, you use the <b>system()</b> procedure.  It executes
the given string as if that string is a 
shell command (<b>sh</b>, not <b>csh</b>, 
although it shouldn't matter).  If it returns zero, the command
succeeded.  If it returns anything else, the command failed.


</p><hr><h2>Strategy</h2>

It's my hope that you don't need these sections on strategy too much, but
to help you out, here's how I wrote this program.

<ul>
<li> Wrote the code to figure out the name of the description file.  Made
my makefile, and tested the code.
</li><li> Wrote the main loop to read the description file (using the 
fields library).  This loop just
calls <b>get_line</b> and prints each line to stdout.
</li><li> Wrote the code to recognize blank lines.
</li><li> Wrote code to recognize the <b>C</b> lines.  All other lines are 
      ignored.
</li><li> Wrote a subroutine to read the <b>C</b> files into a dlist.  After 
      reading the entire description file, I print out the contents of this
      dlist.
</li><li> Wrote code to recognize the <b>H</b> lines, and used the same subroutine
      as above to read the <b>H</b> files into another dlist.  Tested this
      code.
</li><li> Wrote code to recognize and read the <b>L</b> lines -- this used the 
      same subroutine and the filenames went into a third dlist.
</li><li> Wrote code to read in the executable name.  Tested this code.
</li><li> Wrote code to recognize and read in the <b>F</b> lines.  This again
      used the same subroutine as the <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, and <b>L</b> lines.
      The flags are read into another dlist.
</li><li> Wrote code to flag an error for any unprocessed line.  Also flagged
      an error if there is no <b>E</b> line.
</li><li> Wrote code to process the header files.  This code traverses the 
      <b>H</b> dlist, and calls <b>stat</b> on each file.  It flags an error
      if the file doesn't exist.  Otherwise, it returns the maximum value
      of <b>st_mtime</b> to the <b>main()</b> program.
</li><li> Wrote code to start processing the C files.  This code traverses the
      <b>C</b> dlist, and calls <b>stat</b> on each file.  It flags an error
      if the file doesn't exist.  Otherwise, it looks for the <b>.o</b> file.
      If that file doesn't exist, or is less recent than the C file or the
      maximum <b>st_mtime</b> of the header files, then I printed out that
      I need to remake that file.  I tested this code extensively.
</li><li> Wrote code to actually remake the <b>.o</b> files.  This means
      creating the ``<b>gcc -c</b>'' string and printing it out.  Once
      this looked right, I had the program call <b>system()</b> on the 
      string.
</li><li> Finished up the C file subroutine by having it return whether any
      files were remade, or if not, the maximum <b>st_mtime</b> of any
      <b>.o</b> files, to the <b>main()</b> program.
</li><li> Wrote code to test whether or not the executable needed to be made.
</li><li> Finally, I wrote code to make the executable.  First I wrote code
      to create the ``<b>gcc -o</b>'' string, and then I printed out the
      string.  After testing that, I had the program call <b>system()</b>
      on the string.
</li><li> Put finishing touches on the program, and did more testing.
</li></ul>
